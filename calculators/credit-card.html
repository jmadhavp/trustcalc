            <h2>The Cost of Credit Card Debt</h2>
            <p>Credit cards are one of the most expensive ways to borrow money due to high interest rates and monthly compounding. If you only make the <strong>minimum payment</strong>, most of your money goes toward interest rather than reducing your principal balance. This can lead to debt that lasts for decades.</p>
            
            <div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 2rem; background: var(--bg-color); border-radius: 8px;">
                <h3>Usage Example: Paying Off a $5,000 Balance</h3>
                <p>If you have a <strong>$5,000 balance</strong> on a card with a <strong>19.99% APR</strong> and only pay the <strong>2% minimum payment</strong>, it will take you over <strong>22 years</strong> to pay off the debt, and you will pay over <strong>$7,000 in interest alone</strong>. By switching to a fixed payment of <strong>$200 per month</strong>, you could be debt-free in less than <strong>3 years</strong> and pay only about $1,500 in interest.</p>
