            <h1>How Much Mortgage Can I Afford? A Complete Guide for 2026</h1>
            <p>Buying a home is the most significant financial decision most people will ever make. But before you start browsing listings, the most critical question you must answer is: <strong>"How much can I actually afford?"</strong> In this guide, we'll break down the math behind mortgage affordability for both USA and UK residents.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Quick Tip:</strong> Use our <a href="../calculators/mortgage.html">Mortgage Calculator</a> to run your own numbers after reading this guide.
            </div>

            <h2>1. The Golden Rule: The 28/36 Rule (USA Focus)</h2>
            <p>In the United States, lenders often use the "28/36 rule" to determine how much they are willing to lend you. This rule states that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Housing Ratio (28%):</strong> Your total monthly housing costs (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income.</li>
                <li><strong>Total Debt Ratio (36%):</strong> Your total monthly debt payments (including the new mortgage, car loans, credit cards, and student loans) should not exceed 36% of your gross monthly income.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you earn $100,000 annually, your gross monthly income is $8,333. Under the 28% rule, your maximum mortgage payment would be approximately $2,333.</p>

            <h2>2. Understanding UK Lending Multiples</h2>
            <p>In the United Kingdom, affordability is calculated slightly differently. While lenders still look at your "take-home" pay and expenses, they primarily use a <strong>Salary Multiple</strong>. Most UK lenders will offer between 4 and 4.5 times your gross annual salary.</p>
            <p>For a couple earning a combined £80,000, a typical maximum loan would be around £360,000. However, the Bank of England's affordability stress tests also ensure you could still afford the loan if interest rates were to rise by 3%.</p>

            <h2>3. Factors That Impact Your Affordability</h2>
            <h3>Credit Score / Credit Rating</h3>
            <p>Your credit score is the single biggest factor in the interest rate you'll receive. In the US, a score above 740 is considered "excellent" and will net you the lowest rates. In the UK, while there is no universal "score," a clean credit history with Experian or Equifax is essential.</p>

            <h3>The Down Payment</h3>
            <p>The more you put down, the less you borrow. In the US, putting down 20% allows you to avoid Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI). In the UK, a larger deposit usually unlocks better "Loan-to-Value" (LTV) interest rate tiers.</p>

            <h3>Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio</h3>
            <p>Even if you have a high income, high existing debt can disqualify you. Lenders want to see that you have "breathing room" in your budget. If your DTI is over 43%, you may find it difficult to secure a conventional loan. You can calculate your ratio using our <a href="../calculators/dti.html">DTI Calculator</a>.</p>

            <h2>4. Hidden Costs of Homeownership</h2>
            <p>Affordability isn't just the mortgage payment. You must also account for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Property Taxes / Council Tax:</strong> These vary wildly by location.</li>
                <li><strong>Homeowners Insurance / Buildings Insurance:</strong> A mandatory requirement for lenders.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> A good rule of thumb is to set aside 1% of the home's value annually for repairs.</li>
                <li><strong>Closing Costs / Stamp Duty:</strong> Expect to pay 2-5% of the purchase price in upfront fees.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. How to Improve Your Affordability</h2>
            <p>If the numbers don't look the way you want them to, here are three steps to take before applying:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Reduce Existing Debt:</strong> Paying off a car loan can significantly increase your borrowing power.</li>
                <li><strong>Increase Your Credit Score:</strong> Check for errors on your report and ensure all payments are on time.</li>
                <li><strong>Save for a Larger Deposit:</strong> Even an extra 5% can drastically lower your monthly payment and interest rate.</li>
            </ol>
